# Move into Angular CLI
Use the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to build the application and deprecate **lite-server** and **gulp**.

## Setup

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest` to install Angular CLI.

Checkout this branch to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Usage

Run `gulp templatecache` and `npm start` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at **http://localhost:4200**
